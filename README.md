# spam-mail-detection-python-ml
In recent years, spam detection has received significant attention in both business and academics. In this project, we have presented an approach for detecting whether a particular mail is spam or not. We have been successful in implementing this project and we can classify email as spam or ham. This project can also be used for detecting SMS as well as other text messages.



OBJECTIVE
The main objective of the Spam mail detector is:
•	to give knowledge to the user about fake emails and relevant emails
•	to classify whether the mail is spam or not.
•	To classify all related texts as spam or ham.

FUTURE SCOPE

This project is limited to only texts related data. Images, videos and other formats of data are not included. But, in future it might be possible to include these other forms as well.
Also, the current project scope is limited to only English language but can be designed for multiple languages as well. So, let’s just see where Artificial Intelligence and machine learning can take us in future and how it will improve our life further.
